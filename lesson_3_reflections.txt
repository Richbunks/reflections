When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	To have a back up, or when you are collaborating with another person/group so others can see and work on the file.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You would want to pull changes manually as you may not always want the file as changes may be have been made on it and may introduce 
	bugs to your file.
